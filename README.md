You can reach us directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/issues/new/choose), [Discord](https://discord.gg/cYB7GjWNp8), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#placetux:matrix.org), or [Telegram](https://t.me/+ykZ9LXrdFJZkNzRh).

## Tools

### Overlay

If you would like to help us place Tux, we highly recommend you use our overlay! It's a [userscript](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) that runs through a [browser extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension) that will render an image on top of the r/place canvas showing incorrect pixels:

![Overlay example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/main/overlay/example.png)

You can find the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay#installation).

For troubleshooting regarding the overlay see [here](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay#troublshooting), or ask us directly on Discord/Matrix/Telegram.

### Coordinate Guide

If you prefer not to use our overlay, you can check out the [coordinate guide](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay#coordinate-guide).

## Contributing

You can propose a modification to the artwork by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/compare) for [artwork/tux/tux.png](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/blob/main/artwork/tux/tux.png). After we review and accept it, your change(s) will automatically be deployed.\
If you are an ally trying to change your artwork, [PR](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/compare) your corresponding artwork with the updated image in [artwork/allies/](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/artwork/allies)

To change the anchor point of any piece, change the coordinate values in the corresponding entry in your `positions.json`.

You can find the official color palette [here](https://github.com/r-PlaceTux/place_tux/tree/main/overlay#color-palette).

## More information

Our canvas corners:

```
(20,679)  (71,679)
(20,758)  (71,758)
```
### Canvas Size?

Ideally we would take up the entire 2000x1000 canvas for ourselves, but that would make other communities sad... And it's also impossible with a community of this size. We would create 3 progressively larger pixel arts (a 50x50, a 75x75 and a 100x100 version) for Tux and Distro/DE. We would draw the appropriate one in r/place, based on territory gained.

## Why should I use Linux?

#### It respects your freedom and privacy

- You can see every line of code it uses, so you can be sure there is no backdoor or keylogger (The NSA tried 3 times to get a backdoor into linux, but failed)

#### It runs on older computers, saving them from the landfill

- It is very fast and lightweight

- It costs exactly $0

#### It's yours

- **_EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF LINUX_** can be modified however you want, and is only limited by hardware

- It can look real sexy (take a look at [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn/))

- You don't have a giant, monopoly, money-seeking company forcing you to do what it thinks is best for you, making you the product (I'm looking at you Microsoft and Apple...)

- Many, many options to choose from and to customize your system as you see fit

- You get to brag about how smart you are when a Windoze user sees you "hAcKIng" (I use Arch BTW)

#### It's powerful and secure

- The command line is really good and lets you do very complex things in one line, while user-friendly graphic interfaces work well for those that don't want to use commands

- Package managers make installing software a breeze, and always from a verified malware-free source

- It's almost impossible to get a virus in Linux ([meme](https://twitter.com/pr0grammerhum0r/status/1252341297479741442))

- **_TONS_** of support for Linux: ask a question, and in a few minutes people will be responding

- Countless other reasons
